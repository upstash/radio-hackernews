## Radio Hackernews

This app exemplifies the use of Upstash Workflow in a complex AI pipeline. The app is a Hackernews reader that reads the top stories from Hackernews then summarizes them using OpenAI API and then converts them to audio using the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API. The audio is then stored in TigrisData.
